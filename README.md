## JMovie 3: Desktop Edition

At long last, JMovie is now a desktop application available for Windows and Mac.
JMovie is a tool which enables you to view online content without the worry of 
opening malicious links and pop-ups. In this new version, I added custom keyboard commands,
themes, filter and embed lists. Check out <a href='https://fmhy.net' target="_blank">fmhy.net</a> for resources on how to make this your own!

Thank you for the years of support and love. For a more complete description
of how to use the app, there is a detailed README in the "lists" folder that the
app uses to display to the users when they are using it. This project really means
a lot to me, and I put a lot of hard work into something that I hope you will all
use often. Enjoy, -JB.
